# tableify

This repository content a small [react app](https://stormy-beach-24704.herokuapp.com/) I wrote for a discussion group I attend, in Daejeon. [link](https://www.facebook.com/officialdisg/)

During this discussion group we are assigned randomly at tables to meet different people. Usually, we change table 2 time during a meeting (so we attend tree different table).

With some friend, we noticed that too often we would meet the same people twice or even stay twince in a row with a very similar table composition. This app try to remedy this problem, so we can meet more different person :smile:.

### How it works

The repartition should be done at the begining of the meeting. After it's done, tree table are assigned to each people.


1. At the beginning of the meeting and until it's time for a first rotation, keep the number of table updated by adding/removing the table that are used.
2. When you want the repartition to be done, click on the compile button, a table should appear with the optimised repartition.
3. Then give each people the list of the table they will have to attend at each round. The first table should be the table they are currently on.

Tips: you can add a few more place before compiling so that late people will be more easily included... but not too much or you risk having empty tables.

I made this app mainly as a practical work, it's far from being optimal but at least it taught me the basics of the react framwork.  
If you feel like something should be improve, either technically or from an user perspective, feel free to report an issue or create a pull request, or just contact me, I don't expect too much spam from this project anyway :grin:.
